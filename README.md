# CSS Shiba Inu Dog 🐶

A fun little project where I coded a Shiba Inu dog entirely in **HTML + CSS** – no images, no JS, just styles and creativity!  
Built as a playful experiment to showcase how powerful and underrated CSS really is.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone/download the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in any browser.
3. Say hello to your CSS dog! 🐾
